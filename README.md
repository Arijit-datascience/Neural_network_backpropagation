# Neural Network Feedforward and Backpropagation

## Part 1 - Backpropagation Steps:

### Introduction:
Neural Network consists of neurons and connections between these neurons called weights and some biases connected to each neuron.
We move forward through the network called the forward pass, we iteratively use a formula to calculate each neuron in the next layer.

The network goes forward until we get an output. In this case we have one input layer, one hidden layer and last the output layer.
Our aim is to optimize the cost function. This is done by adjusting the weights based on errors generated by them through a backward pass.

To update the network, we calculate gradients w.r.t. each weights in every layer.
### Weight updation in next iteration
We simple calculate gradient of cost function w.r.t. the weight 

The below screenshot is from the excel file "Back Propagation.xlsx" in the repository.
This shows how feed forward network and back propagation works.
